    <div class="history-section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Our History</h2>
        <p class="paragraph-text">When the founders came to the U.S. in 1988 in search of a better life, they found it difficult to adjust to a culture that had a great consumption of meat and fewer places that would suit their needs. This struggle sparked the birth of our restaurant, Roots of Asia- a place to bring comfort to people with similar experiences through food. Over the years, personal stories wove into a tapestry of life and emotions as one has had to leave loved ones behind, others found their way to stable ground, while others harnessed their strengths and overcame life's battering. The concept of Roots of Asia is that of a haven that invites everybody irrelevant of origin and identity. It is a place where anybody will find their home and get some solace. No one gets turned away from here. Every meal served has the essence of emotions: joy, sorrow, anger, or hope. Each visitor leaves a part of their story behind, enriching the soul of the restaurant. This exchange makes Roots of Asia more than just a dining space; it's a haven that fosters an environment filled with unity, love, and the creation of cherished memories that will resound for generations to come.
