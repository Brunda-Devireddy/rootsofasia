           <h2><u>Ingredient Sourcing</u></h2>
           <p>
               We believe that the best dishes start with the best ingredients. Our restaurant partners with <span class="highlight">local organic farms</span> to source fresh, seasonal produce. By working closely with nearby farmers who practice <span class="highlight">sustainable agriculture</span>, we ensure that every ingredient is grown responsibly and without harmful pesticides.
           </p>
           <p>
               Additionally, we minimize our carbon footprint by using <span class="highlight">eco-friendly transportation</span> methods to bring these ingredients from farm to table.

           <h2><u>Authentic Cooking Methods</u></h2>
           <p>
               In keeping with our dedication to traditional Asian cuisine, we use time-honored cooking techniques that enhance natural flavors. Techniques such as <span class="highlight">wok cooking</span> and steaming allow us to create vibrant dishes with minimal processing, keeping each ingredient’s essence intact.

           <h2><u>Minimal Waste Ways</u></h2>
           <p>
               Respecting our ingedients means using every part possible. We adopt a <span class="highlight">minimal waste approach</span> by composting, reusing food scraps for broths, and donating excess food. This reduces waste and aligns with our mission to protect the environment.
